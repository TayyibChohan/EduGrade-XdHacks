# EduGrade-XdHacks

EduGrade is a tool made to innovate and improve lectures. The tool seeks to engage students and automate tasks for teachers. The tool provides useful metrics to manage and track the classroom as well as specialise and tailor to individual needs. It improves upon our century old teaching methods. The prototype uses python in addition to the google sheets API to provide students with relevant questions and teachers with relevant data during lectures. The program is easily expandable, free, and widely accessible. Students can run the prototype without installing any extraneous software, as itâ€™s compiled into a single executable file. The project as a concept demonstrates the value of data in improving the education system. To further this we conducted a survey that showed that the vast majority of students believe that an increase in data in relation to themselves will improve their grades. The nature of the project is economically and socially feasible given the demand for data by teachers and students alike and the widespread adoption of computers and cell phones. EduGrade differentiates itself through its accessibility, ease of use, and impact.  In the future possibilities are endless including digital textbooks, cross platform programs, and class chat rooms.
